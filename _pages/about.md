I'm a currently postdoctoral fellow at [the University of Texas at Austin](https://www.jsg.utexas.edu/researcher/jiawei_da/), funded by the [NSF-FRES CO<sub>2</sub>PIP project](https://paleo-co2.org/co2pip).   

My interests lie in isotope geochemistry, data analysis, and critical thinking. My current research projects primarily focus on deciphering diverse surface processes through the analysis of geochemical signals preserved in terrestrial archives.

Apart from doing research🧐🧪🔬💻, you can find me engaged in various outdoor🥾🏔️🛶🏋🏀 and indoor🎥🎮🥘 activities.
