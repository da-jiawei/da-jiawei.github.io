I'm a currently NASA Postdoctoral Scholar at **the Pennsylvania State University**.   

I am excited about isotope geochemistry, data analysis, and critical thinking. My research focuses on deciphering surface processes using various geochemical proxies. 

Apart from doing research🧐🧪🔬💻, you can find me engaged in various outdoor🥾🏔️🛶🏋🏀 and indoor🎥🎮🥘 activities.
