Rainfall seasonality varies greatly across Earth, ranging from the Mediterranean climate characterized by dry summers and wet winters to the monsoonal climate that experiences heavy rainfall during the summer months. Consequently, the seasonal rainfall distributions have a profound impact on water availability and regional ecosystems. The water cycle in East Asia is primarily driven by the East Asian monsoon system, which interacts dynamically with the westerly jet and regional topography, such as the Tibetan Plateau[^1]. Notably, the Neogene expansion of C<sub>4</sub> grassland over East Asia occurred in a spatiotemporally heterogenuous manner, significantly delayed compared to other continents, indicating a crucial role of local effects in this process.

Here we propose that C4 expansion over East Asia was primarily driven by rainfall seasonality, which is in turn governed by the latitudinal migration of the westerly jet in response to changes in the meridional temperature gradient. To test this hypothesis, we reconstructed rainfall \\(\delta^{18}\\)O using the \\(\delta^{18}\\)O, \\(\Delta_{47}\\), and \\(\Delta^{'17}\\)O of carbonate nodules from the Red Clay formation on the Chinese Loess Plateau, spanning 8-2.5 million years ago. Soil carbonates are generally formed in oxygen isotope equilibrium with ambient soil waters, the latter of which inherit the \\(\delta^{18}\\)O of rainfall but can be strongly affected by subsequent processes such as evaporation. With the help of soil-carbonate \\(\Delta^{'17}\\)O[^2], we can parse out the effect of evaporation and reconstruct changes in rainfall-\\(\delta^{18}\\)O, which contain information of regional hydrological cycle and large-scale air circulation patterns.

Our records suggest increases in rainfall-\\(\delta^{18}O\\) during warmer climates such as the early Pliocene, which cannot be explained by changes in rainfall amount. Instead, we propose that rainfall seasons switched from summer to spring under warmer climates, as a result of more poleward position of the westerly jet and thus an early onset of Meiyu in northern China. In this respect, northern China is likely going to experience more spring rainfall and summer drought as global warming proceeds.
