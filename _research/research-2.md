Soil carbonates are a common terrestrial archive for paleoclimate studies. For instance, their stable isotope compositions contain abundant information such as past changes in regional water cycle, the evolution of C4 vegetation, and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations.

However, both their carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions are affected by multiple environmental forcings, which can be difficult to disentangle in paleo contexts. Additionally, soil carbonates tend to form under
