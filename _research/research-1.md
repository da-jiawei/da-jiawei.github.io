As the nearest geologic time period, the late Cenozoic witnessed major climate transitions such as the Northern Hemisphere Glaciation and the Mid-Pleistocene Transition, as well as time periods widely recognized as analogs of near-future climate such as the Mid-Miocene Climate Optimum and the Mid-Pliocene Warm Period. However, the role of CO<sub>2</sub> in these climate events remain unresolved, mainly due to the lack of high-resolution, high-precision CO<sub>2</sub> record.

The Chinese Loess Plateau has been receiving eolian dust deposition since the late Oligocene. Paleosols developed on these eolian deposits contain secondary carbonates, the carbon isotope values of which recorded atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels. Leveraging this unique archive, we improved the paleosol-CO<sub>2</sub> method by developing new constraint on the input parameters, allowing us to reconstruct a continuous Pleistocene CO<sub>2</sub> record with high fidelity.

The results show relatively stable CO<sub>2</sub> during the interglacial periods and long-term decline in glacial CO<sub>2</sub>, highlighting the role of CO<sub>2</sub> in the amplification of the Pleistocene glacial cycles and the long-term global cooling. Moreover, our CO<sub>2</sub> data suggest climate sensitivity remained relatively stable when the Earth's climate transitioned between glacial and interglacial periods.
