As the nearest geologic time period, the late Cenozoic witnessed major climate transitions such as the Northern Hemisphere Glaciation and the Mid-Pleistocene Transition, as well as time periods widely recognized as analogs of near-future climate such as the Mid-Miocene Climate Optimum and the Mid-Pliocene Warm Period. However, the role of CO<sub>2</sub> in these climate events remain unresolved, mainly due to the lack of high-resolution, high-precision CO<sub>2</sub> record.

The Chinese Loess Plateau has been receiving eolian dust deposition since the late Oligocene. The paleosols developed on these eolian deposits hold valuable information of the long-term evolution of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels. Leveraging this unique archive, we improved the classic paleosol-CO<sub>2</sub> method by developing new constraint on the input parameter and new sampling method, allowing us to reconstruct a continuous Pleistocene CO<sub>2</sub> record with high fidelity.

The results show relatively stable CO<sub>2</sub> during the interglacial periods and long-term decline in glacial CO<sub>2</sub>, highlighting the role of CO<sub>2</sub> in the amplification of the glacial cycles and the long-term global cooling. Moreover, our CO<sub>2</sub> data suggest increasing climate sensitivity under higher CO<sub>2</sub> levels, and overall higher climate sensitivity than model projections, indicating a potentially underestimated future warming.
