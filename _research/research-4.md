Methyl groups (R-CH<sub>3</sub>) are ubiquitous in the universe. However, it can be produced by both abiotic and biogenic processes. It is therefore necessary to develop a proxy capable of discriminating these two processes in search for extraterrestrial life.

Biogenic methyl groups formed via methylreductase likely experienced strong kinetic isotope effect, leading to its clumped isotopologues signficantly different from those formed through purely abiotic processes. This project aims to test this hypothesis by measuring and comparing the Δ<sup>13</sup>CH2D and Δ<sup>12</sup>CHD<sub>2</sub> of commerical acetate versus those produced by several archaea grown under various substrates.
